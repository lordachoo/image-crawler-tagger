# Progress: Image Tagger

## What Works
1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Web crawler integration with website_image_crawler.py
   - Image downloading and storage system
   - Basic tagging system for images
   - Image gallery with filtering capability
   - Crawl job management

2. **Recent Additions**:
   - Pagination system for job details page to handle large image collections (5000+ images)
   - Job-specific tag filtering to show only relevant tags in the interface
   - Bulk tagging system on job details and images pages
   - Tag suggestions via dropdown menus using HTML5 datalist
   - Common tags section for quick application of frequent tags
   - Asynchronous tag operations without page reloads
   - Original source URL tracking for crawled images

## What's Left to Build
1. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for API endpoints
   - Integration tests for tag operations
   - Testing for concurrent crawl job handling

2. **Features to Consider**:
   - Tag categories or hierarchical tags
   - Batch operations beyond tagging (delete, move, etc.)
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - User authentication system
   - Image statistics and reporting

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on enhancing the tagging workflow efficiency, particularly:

1. Making the bulk tagging system more accessible and intuitive
2. Fixing UI issues like truncated filenames
3. Ensuring proper tracking of image source URLs

The project is ready for basic production use with active development ongoing to improve features and stability.

## Known Issues
1. No dedicated error handling page for application errors
2. Limited validation on some form inputs
3. No automated testing implemented yet
4. No user authentication/authorization system

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Database**: Started with SQLite for development, migrated to PostgreSQL for production readiness
2. **UI Architecture**: Initially relied on page reloads for updates, evolved to use asynchronous API calls
3. **Crawler Integration**: Started with direct code inclusion, changed to dynamic importing for better separation of concerns
4. **Tagging Interface**: Originally simple form submissions, evolved to quick tagging with suggestions and bulk operations
