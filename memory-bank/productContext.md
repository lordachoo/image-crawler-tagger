# Product Context: Image Tagger

## Purpose
The Image Tagger application exists to solve the challenge of efficiently collecting, organizing, and retrieving images from websites. It bridges the gap between web crawling and a structured image management system by providing tools to quickly gather images and systematically tag them.

## Problems Solved
1. **Image Collection**: Automatically crawls websites to discover and download images, eliminating the need for manual downloading
2. **Organization**: Provides a tagging system to categorize and classify images, addressing the challenge of managing large image collections
3. **Retrieval**: Enables quick finding of specific images through tag-based filtering and search
4. **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduces the time spent on image management tasks through bulk operations and quick tagging features

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Provide an intuitive interface that requires minimal training to use effectively
2. **Efficiency**: Enable users to process large batches of images with minimal clicks through features like bulk tagging
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensure the application responds quickly to user actions, especially for common operations
4. **Flexibility**: Support various tagging strategies to accommodate different organizational needs
5. **Seamless Integration**: Integrate the crawler component so users don't need to manage separate tools

## Target Workflow
1. User initiates a crawl job by providing a website URL and parameters
2. The system downloads images according to specified criteria (formats, depth, etc.)
3. User reviews downloaded images in the job details page
4. User quickly applies tags to multiple images using the bulk tagging feature
5. User can refine tagging by adding/removing individual tags as needed
6. Images can be filtered and located later using the tag system

## Success Metrics
1. Reduction in time spent organizing images
2. Number of images that can be processed per hour
3. Effectiveness of tag-based retrieval (can users find what they need quickly?)
4. System reliability during crawl jobs
5. User satisfaction with the tagging workflow
